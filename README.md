## Detailed Installation Instructions


### Day 1
Two software needed: FIJI and ilastik. Trainees need to
1. Download FIJI from [https://fiji.sc/](https://fiji.sc/), selecting your operating system, and extract the .zip folder. The software is ready for use.

2. Download and install ilastik from [https://www.ilastik.org/](https://www.ilastik.org/download#stable:~:text=tracking%20with%20learning.-,Regular%20builds,-Windows%20(64%2Dbit)), selecting your operative system.



### Day 2
The hands-on session will rely on the use of FIJI and ilastik (installed on Day 1).


### Day 3
Two software needed: CellProfiler and CellProfiler Analyst. Trainees need to
1. Download and install CellProfiler from [https://cellprofiler.org/](https://cellprofiler.org/), selecting your operating system.

2. Download and install CellProfiler Analyst from [https://cellprofileranalyst.org/](https://cellprofileranalyst.org/).


### Day 4
Two software needed: Inkscape for figure preparation and napari.

1. Download and install Inkscape from [inkscape.org](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.4.2/) 

2. Install napari

During the hands-on sessions we will extensively try and retry the software installation with conda environments, however to gain some practice and proceed smoothly to more interesting topics, please proceed with the following homework before the workshop

#### 1. Install Anaconda Navigator
#### 2. Install napari within conda prompt

Please make sure to have at least 10-15 GB free on the pc you will bring with you for participating in the workshop. Please let us know well in advance if you cannot bring a pc with you, we might be able to get a loan, however this is not guaranteed and you might risk to have no pc to follow along.

#### 1. Install Anaconda Navigator
This is a method that use the graphical user interface to download and install Anaconda Navigator.
Please visit https://docs.anaconda.com/ and click on the green button "Download Anaconda". You will be asked to provide an email address and will receive the link to the download page, where you will choose the version for your OS.

Before installing Anaconda Navigator, please identify a folder in your computer over which you have full permission of read and write file: we will create and update many times conda environments, this means that the software will install and remove files all the times.

#### 2. Install napari within conda prompt
The successful installation of Anaconda Navigator will make available an app called "Anaconda prompt". This is the terminal that we will use to create and work with conda environments.

**Step 1: Update conda**
```bash
conda update -n base -c conda-forge conda
```

**Step 2: Create environment** (replace `workshop-env` with your preferred name)
```bash
conda create -n workshop-env python=3.12
```

**Step 3: Activate environment**
```bash
conda activate workshop-env
```
You should notice a change in the prompt where the name "base" at the beginning of the prompt has been changed to "workshop-env". This confirms that it is safe to install new packages, as you are not altering the base environment (safe choice is not to touch "base").

**Step 4: Install napari**
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge napari pyqt
```

**Step 5: Test installation**
At this point, if no error appears in the terminal as result of the operations above, you are ready to open napari executing:
```bash
napari
```
##### Create a conda environment with a recipe
If a working environment cannot be created through the commands above, the following recipe can be used to create an environment with napari

a) Download the file [cbias2024-napari-env.yml](https://github.com/FrancisCrickInstitute/CBIAS_napari_workshop_2024/tree/main/envs/cbias2024-napari-env.yml) into a local folder

b) use the Anaconda prompt to navigate to the local folder and execute
```
conda env create -f cbias2024-napari-env.yml
```
This should create an environment with the same name of the .yml file unless otherwise specified.

c) check that napari opens

At this point, if no error appears in the terminal as result of the operations above, you are ready to open napari executing
```
napari
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **napari won't start**: Ensure you've activated the correct conda environment
- **Installation fails**: Check you have sufficient disk space (10-15 GB required)
- **Conda environment conflicts**: Use a unique environment name like `workshop-2025-env`
- **Can't bring laptop**: Contact organizers at least 1 week before the workshop

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues during installation:
1. Check the software documentation links above
2. Contact the workshop organizers for technical support
3. Join early for Day 1 - we'll have limited time for installation troubleshooting

### Contact Information

- **Technical questions**: Contact workshop trainers via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues)
- **Workshop logistics**: Contact local organizers - Domenico Russo, Simone Di Paola, Seetharaman Parashuraman
